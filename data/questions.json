  {"id":1,"topic":"Phishing awareness","question":"You receive an email that looks like it is from the university saying your account will be locked in 1 hour unless you click a link and log in. What is the safest first step?","options":["Click the link quickly before the deadline passes","Reply to the email and ask if it is real","Ignore the email completely and hope nothing happens","Open a new tab and log in to the official university website directly"],"correctIndex":3,"explanation":"A common phishing trick is to create fake urgency. Going directly to the official website yourself avoids dodgy links and lets you check your account safely.","tip":"When a message feels rushed or threatening, avoid clicking its links and instead visit the official site in a new tab."},
  {"id":2,"topic":"Phishing awareness","question":"A friend messages you on a chat app asking you to vote for them in a competition using a strange looking link. Their previous messages in the chat look normal. What should you consider first?","options":["Assume it is safe because it came from your friend","Check the link preview or URL carefully and consider asking your friend outside the app if they really sent it","Click the link on your phone but not your laptop","Forward the message to more friends so they can help"],"correctIndex":1,"explanation":"Accounts can be taken over, so you should treat unexpected links with caution even if they come from a friend. Verifying using another channel is a good habit.","tip":"If a friend sends a random link that feels off, confirm with them using another method before clicking it."},
  {"id":3,"topic":"Phishing awareness","question":"You receive an email that greets you as \"Dear Student\" and says you won a random laptop giveaway if you fill in your personal details. It has spelling mistakes and a free email address as the sender. What is this most likely to be?","options":["A routine message from the university","A harmless spam email you can safely reply to","A phishing attempt trying to collect your details","A genuine offer that just looks unprofessional"],"correctIndex":2,"explanation":"Generic greetings, spelling mistakes, and free email addresses are common signs of phishing emails that want your personal information.","tip":"Watch out for generic greetings, spelling errors, and free email senders in messages that ask for your details."},
  {"id":4,"topic":"Phishing awareness","question":"Your email client flags a message with a big warning saying it might be phishing. The message asks you to download an attachment to \"verify your account\". What is the safest option?","options":["Open the attachment to see what it is before deciding","Ignore the warning because email filters are always wrong","Delete the email or report it using the built-in report or spam button","Forward the email to all your friends so they can check it"],"correctIndex":2,"explanation":"If your email system already suspects phishing and the message asks you to download something to verify an account, it is safest to delete or report it.","tip":"When your email client flags something as phishing, treat it seriously and avoid opening attachments or links from that message."},
  {"id":5,"topic":"Phishing awareness","question":"An email says \"Reply to this address to confirm your place\" but the Reply-To address is different from the From address and uses a random-looking domain. What does this suggest?","options":["The sender uses two different email systems","The message might be fake and replies could go to an attacker","Universities always use different Reply-To addresses","You should reply as quickly as possible"],"correctIndex":1,"explanation":"When Reply-To does not match the sender and uses an odd domain, it is a strong sign of phishing so that your reply goes to the attacker.","tip":"Check that the Reply-To address matches who you think you are replying to, and that the domain looks legitimate."},
  {"id":6,"topic":"Phishing awareness","question":"True or false: Hovering over a link before clicking it can show you the real destination URL and help you spot fake links.","options":["True","False"],"correctIndex":0,"explanation":"Most browsers show the real URL in the status bar or a tooltip when you hover. That can reveal if the link goes somewhere different from what the text says.","tip":"Get into the habit of hovering over links to see where they really go before you click."},
  {"id":7,"topic":"Phishing awareness","question":"An email claims to be from \"IT Support\" and asks you to click a link to \"restore access\". The link text says \"secure-login.university.ac.uk\" but when you hover, the URL is \"secure-login.uni-verify.com\". What should you do?","options":["Click the link because the text looks official","Do not click; the real URL does not match and the message is likely phishing","Reply to the email to ask for help","Forward the email to IT support"],"correctIndex":1,"explanation":"The visible link text can say anything; the real URL is what matters. A mismatch between text and destination is a classic phishing sign.","tip":"The link text can be faked. Always check the actual URL (e.g. by hovering) before clicking."},
  {"id":8,"topic":"Phishing awareness","question":"True or false: Legitimate organisations often send emails that say \"Your account will be closed in 24 hours\" and ask you to click a link to fix it.","options":["True","False"],"correctIndex":1,"explanation":"Real organisations usually give clear notices and ways to fix issues through their official site or app, not via a single urgent link in an email.","tip":"Extreme urgency plus a single link is a common phishing pattern; real companies rarely work that way."},
  {"id":9,"topic":"Phishing awareness","question":"You get an email that says \"Dear Valued Customer\" and asks you to update your payment details via a link. You have an account with that company. What is the safest approach?","options":["Click the link and log in to update your details","Open the company website yourself in a new tab and log in there to check for any real messages","Reply to the email with your new card number","Forward the email to your bank"],"correctIndex":1,"explanation":"Going to the company site yourself (via search or a bookmark) avoids fake links. You can then see if there are any real alerts in your account.","tip":"Never use links in emails to update payment or account details; always go to the official site yourself."},
  {"id":10,"topic":"Phishing awareness","question":"A message says \"Your package could not be delivered\" and asks you to open an attachment for instructions. You are not expecting a package. What is the best action?","options":["Open the attachment to see what it says","Delete the message without opening the attachment","Reply and ask for a new delivery","Forward the attachment to a friend to open"],"correctIndex":1,"explanation":"Unexpected attachments, especially about deliveries you did not expect, are often used to deliver malware. Deleting without opening is safest.","tip":"Do not open attachments from unexpected or suspicious messages; they can contain malware."},
  {"id":11,"topic":"Password security","question":"You currently use the same 8-character password for your email, social media, and university account. What is the main risk of this approach?","options":["You will forget which account you are using","If one site is hacked, attackers can try the same password everywhere","Websites will block you for using the same password","Your friends will guess it easily without trying"],"correctIndex":1,"explanation":"Reusing passwords means a breach on one website can give attackers access to many of your other accounts.","tip":"Use different passwords for important accounts so a single breach does not unlock everything at once."},
  {"id":12,"topic":"Password security","question":"Which of these is the best example of a strong password for a university account?","options":["Adam2024","UniPass123","CoffeeHorseBus!Rain","ManchesterUnited"],"correctIndex":2,"explanation":"A long passphrase made from random words with some symbols is usually much harder to guess or crack than short, predictable words.","tip":"Consider using longer passphrases made from several unrelated words rather than short, predictable passwords."},
  {"id":13,"topic":"Password security","question":"Your browser offers to save your password for a rarely used forum account. What is normally the safest choice?","options":["Write the password on a sticky note and put it on your laptop","Let the browser save it and protect the device with a strong login and screen lock","Email the password to yourself so you can search for it later","Use the same easy password on all sites so you never forget"],"correctIndex":1,"explanation":"Modern browsers can store passwords securely, as long as your device itself is protected with a strong login and lock screen.","tip":"If you let your browser remember passwords, make sure your device login is strong and you lock your screen when you walk away."},
  {"id":14,"topic":"Password security","question":"True or false: Two-factor authentication (2FA) means that even if someone steals your password, they still need a second step (like a code on your phone) to log in.","options":["True","False"],"correctIndex":0,"explanation":"2FA adds a second check (e.g. a code or notification) so that the password alone is not enough to access your account.","tip":"Turn on 2FA for your email and university account when it is available."},
  {"id":15,"topic":"Password security","question":"A website you use has been breached and your password may have been exposed. What should you do first?","options":["Change your password on that site only","Change your password on that site and on any other site where you used the same password","Do nothing if you have not noticed any problems","Share the news with friends so they can check their passwords too"],"correctIndex":1,"explanation":"If you reused that password elsewhere, those accounts are at risk. Change the password on the breached site and on any other site that had the same one.","tip":"After a breach, change the affected password and any other account that used the same password."},
  {"id":16,"topic":"Password security","question":"Which of these is a bad place to store your passwords?","options":["A password manager app that you protect with a strong master password","A locked note on your phone that only you can open","A sticky note on your monitor","Writing them in a notebook you keep in a drawer at home"],"correctIndex":2,"explanation":"Passwords on a monitor are visible to anyone who walks past. A password manager or a locked note is much safer.","tip":"Avoid storing passwords where others can see them, such as on sticky notes or in unencrypted files."},
  {"id":17,"topic":"Password security","question":"True or false: Using your name, birthday, or favourite team in a password makes it easier to remember but also easier for others to guess.","options":["True","False"],"correctIndex":0,"explanation":"Personal details are easy to find on social media or through conversation, so they make passwords predictable.","tip":"Avoid using obvious personal information in passwords; use unrelated words or a password manager instead."},
  {"id":18,"topic":"Password security","question":"A friend asks you to log in to your university account on their laptop so they can \"quickly check something\". What is the safest response?","options":["Log in and stay with them while they use it","Say no and suggest they use their own account or the library computers","Log in and then change your password later","Let them use your password so they can log in themselves"],"correctIndex":1,"explanation":"Sharing your login or using your account on someone else's device can expose your account and break university rules.","tip":"Do not share your university login or use it on devices you do not control."},
  {"id":19,"topic":"Password security","question":"How often is it generally recommended to change important passwords (e.g. email, university) if there is no known breach?","options":["Every week","Every few months or when you suspect a risk","Never, only when forced by the site","Once a year on the same date"],"correctIndex":1,"explanation":"Regular changes every few months or when you suspect something is wrong can limit damage. There is no single rule; focus on strong, unique passwords and 2FA.","tip":"Combine strong unique passwords with occasional changes and 2FA rather than reusing one password forever."},
  {"id":20,"topic":"Password security","question":"You forget your password for a site and click \"Forgot password\". The site sends a reset link to your email. What should you do?","options":["Ignore the email if you did not request it","Use the link in the email only if you actually requested the reset, and complete the process yourself","Forward the reset link to a friend to help","Reply to the email with your new password"],"correctIndex":1,"explanation":"If you requested the reset, use the link from the official email and set a new password. If you did not request it, do not use the link and secure your account.","tip":"Only use password reset links when you requested them, and always go through the official email from the service."},
  {"id":21,"topic":"Online privacy","question":"You are about to post a photo of your new student ID card on social media. What is the best action?","options":["Post it publicly so friends can see your new card","Post it but blur or cover any sensitive details before sharing","Post it only in a group chat with strangers","Post it and delete it after a few minutes"],"correctIndex":1,"explanation":"Photos of ID cards can expose numbers, names, and other details that can be misused. If you really want to share, sensitive parts should be hidden first.","tip":"Avoid posting pictures that reveal student numbers, addresses, or ID details, even if the post is meant to be casual."},
  {"id":22,"topic":"Online privacy","question":"A mobile app asks for access to your location all the time, even when you are not using it. The app is only for reading articles. What should you think about?","options":["Location access is always required for any app","You should grant access because saying no might break your phone","This permission seems unnecessary and you can deny it or uninstall the app","You should turn on location because it might speed up the internet"],"correctIndex":2,"explanation":"If an app requests permissions that do not match what it actually needs to do, it can be a privacy risk and you can safely say no or remove it.","tip":"Check whether app permissions match what the app really needs, and turn off anything that feels unrelated."},
  {"id":23,"topic":"Online privacy","question":"You join a new group chat with people you do not know well. What is a good privacy habit?","options":["Share your full home address so people can send you things","Send a photo of your student card to prove you are real","Keep personal details vague and avoid sharing things like your exact address or daily routine","Post screenshots of your bank app to show you paid your share"],"correctIndex":2,"explanation":"In new or mixed groups, it is safer to keep personal details vague and avoid oversharing about where you live or your schedule.","tip":"In group chats with new people, avoid posting exact addresses, routines, or other details that could be misused."},
  {"id":24,"topic":"Online privacy","question":"True or false: Once you delete a post or photo from a social media account, it is guaranteed that no one else has saved or shared it.","options":["True","False"],"correctIndex":1,"explanation":"Others can screenshot, save, or share content before you delete it. Deleting only removes it from your account, not from everywhere.","tip":"Assume anything you post can be copied or shared; only post what you are comfortable with being saved by others."},
  {"id":25,"topic":"Online privacy","question":"A new game app asks for access to your contacts, photos, and microphone. The game is a simple puzzle with no multiplayer.

Denying unrelated permissions is safe; if the app really needs them it will ask again or explain.","tip":"Only grant permissions that make sense for what the app does; say no to the rest."},
  {"id":26,"topic":"Online privacy","question":"You want to use a public Wi‑Fi in a café to check your university email. What is a good habit?","options":["Log in as usual; public Wi‑Fi is always safe","Use the university VPN if you have one, or avoid doing sensitive logins on public Wi‑Fi","Share the Wi‑Fi password with strangers so they can get online","Turn off your device's firewall to speed up the connection"],"correctIndex":1,"explanation":"Public Wi‑Fi can be monitored. Using a VPN or avoiding sensitive logins there reduces the chance of someone intercepting your traffic.","tip":"On public Wi‑Fi, use a VPN for sensitive tasks or wait until you are on a trusted network."},
  {"id":27,"topic":"Online privacy","question":"True or false: Making your social media profile \"friends only\" means that only people you approve can see your posts.","options":["True","False"],"correctIndex":0,"explanation":"Friends-only settings limit visibility to people you have accepted as friends, though they can still screenshot and share.","tip":"Use privacy settings to limit who can see your posts, but remember friends can still copy or share what you post."},
  {"id":28,"topic":"Online privacy","question":"A website asks you to sign in with your social media account to get a discount. What should you consider?","options":["Always use social login because it is faster","Check what data the site will access; you can often limit it or use an email sign-up instead","Use the same password as your social account for the site","Create a new social account just for that site"],"correctIndex":1,"explanation":"Social login can share a lot of data.

  {"id":29,"topic":"Online privacy","question":"You receive a message from someone you do not know asking for your phone number \"to complete a survey\". What is the safest approach?","options":["Give a fake number to be helpful","Do not share your number; legitimate surveys do not need to collect it this way","Share your number but ask them to delete it after","Share only the last four digits"],"correctIndex":1,"explanation":"Real surveys usually do not need your phone number from a random message. Sharing it with strangers can lead to spam or scams.","tip":"Do not give your phone number or other contact details to strangers who message you out of the blue."},
